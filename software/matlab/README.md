# MATLAB App for Biomedical Instrumentation Laboratory

This folder contains a MATLAB App developed to support biomedical instrumentation teaching and research. The app enables visualization, filtering, and basic analysis of biosignals such as EMG.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

	â”œâ”€ `app` â€“ MATLAB App Designer `.mlapp` file and `.prj` project file.
	â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ `images` â€“ Icons, plots, and GUI illustrations used in the app.
	â”‚   â””â”€â”€ `functions` â€“ Modular `.m` helper functions used by the app.
 	â”œâ”€ `liveScripts` â€“ Lessons Live Script '.mlx. files
	â”œâ”€ `data` â€“ Example `.mat` or `.csv` data for testing and demonstration.
	â”œâ”€ `docs` â€“ User and developer documentation (e.g., PDFs).
	â””â”€ `tests` â€“ Optional test scripts for verifying function behavior.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Open the project: `app/BiomedicalApp.prj`
2. Launch the app: Run `BiomedicalInstrumentationApp.mlapp` in App Designer.
3. Explore helper functions in the `functions/` folder.

## ðŸ§ª Example Features

- Load and visualize raw EMG data
- Apply customizable filters
- Compute RMS, MAV, and other features
- Export filtered data


## ðŸ’¬ AI Acknowledgment
- Portions of the code were suggested using MATLAB Copilot 
(MathWorks, 2025), a generative AI assistant integrated into MATLAB for 
code completion and contextual suggestions
- ChatGPT was used for rewording lesson content and pedagogical suggestions
