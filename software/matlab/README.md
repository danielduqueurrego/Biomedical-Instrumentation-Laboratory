# MATLAB App for Biomedical Instrumentation Laboratory

This folder contains a MATLAB App developed to support biomedical instrumentation teaching and research. The app enables visualization, filtering, and basic analysis of biosignals such as EMG.

## ðŸ“‚ Folder Structure

- `app/` â€“ MATLAB App Designer `.mlapp` file and `.prj` project file.
- `functions/` â€“ Modular `.m` helper functions used by the app.
- `data/` â€“ Example `.mat` or `.csv` data for testing and demonstration.
- `images/` â€“ Icons, plots, and GUI illustrations used in the app.
- `docs/` â€“ User and developer documentation (e.g., PDFs).
- `tests/` â€“ Optional test scripts for verifying function behavior.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. Open the project: `app/BiomedicalApp.prj`
2. Launch the app: Run `BiomedicalInstrumentationApp.mlapp` in App Designer.
3. Explore helper functions in the `functions/` folder.

## ðŸ§ª Example Features

- Load and visualize raw EMG data
- Apply customizable filters
- Compute RMS, MAV, and other features
- Export filtered data
