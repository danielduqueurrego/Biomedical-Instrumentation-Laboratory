## 👨‍🏫 Usage

This material is designed for educators and researchers in biomedical engineering. You're welcome to:
- Use these materials in your own labs or classrooms.
- Modify or extend the designs for your own needs.
- Contribute improvements via pull requests or issues.

If you need to start with a brief **MATLAB introduction**, I recommend starting with the live scripts found in [`software/matlab/liveScripts`](software/matlab/liveScripts/)
